# Enabling Experimental Features

By default the experimental features are disabled. To enable them, you need to set the `torizon.experimentalFeatures`, setting it to `true` in the VS Code settings:

```json
    "torizon.experimentalFeatures": true
```

> ⚠️ The experimental features are not stable and can be changed or removed in the future.
