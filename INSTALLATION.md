# How To Install

The actual extension installation is done by VS Code getting it from Visual Studio Code Marketplace. But before you can install the extension, you need to install some dependencies.

## Pre-requisites

### üêß Linux

- [Debian stable](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/) or [Ubuntu LTS](https://ubuntu.com/blog/tag/LTS#download) installed on your distro.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your distro.
- [PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1) installed on your machine.
- Docker installed on your distro.
  - Install Docker Engine for [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) or [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
- [Docker Compose Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your distro.

After the Docker installation, you need to add your user to the `docker` group. This is required to run the Docker commands without `sudo`:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### ü™ü Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview) installed on your machine as **WSL 2** distribution.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on **Windows** side.
- [PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1) installed on **WSL 2** distro.
- Docker installed on your **WSL 2** distro.
  - Install Docker Engine for [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) or [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
- [Docker Compose Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on **WSL 2** distro.

After the Docker installation, you need to add your user to the `docker` group. This is required to run the Docker commands without `sudo`. In a new terminal from the **WSL 2** distro run the following commands:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
